# Mars Colonizer

A realistic Mars colonization simulation game with multiple resource types and complex building requirements.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.
2. Click on Mars to gather minerals, your basic resource.
3. Use minerals to construct basic buildings like mineral extractors and solar panels.
4. Balance multiple resources (minerals, water, energy, food, and science) to unlock new buildings and technologies.
5. Purchase upgrades to boost your production capacity.
6. Unlock milestones as you progress to expand your Mars colony.

## Game Features

- Multi-resource management system with 5 different resource types:
  - Minerals: Basic construction material
  - Water: Extracted from ice deposits 
  - Energy: Generated from solar and nuclear sources
  - Food: Produced in greenhouses and hydroponics
  - Science: Research points to unlock new technologies
- Over 10 different buildings, each with unique resource requirements and production
- Strategic upgrades that enhance resource production
- Milestone system to track your colonization progress
- Realistic resource dependencies (water extractors need energy, habitats need food, etc.)
- Automatic save system with offline progress calculation
- Statistics tracking for your colonization efforts
- Sound effects (can be toggled on/off)
- Mobile-responsive design

## Resource Management

The core of the game revolves around balancing various resources:

- **Minerals** - Your most basic resource, gathered by clicking and extractors
- **Energy** - Required to power most buildings
- **Water** - Extracted from ice deposits, essential for life support
- **Food** - Necessary to support colonists and researchers
- **Science** - Research points that unlock advanced buildings and upgrades

All buildings have both costs and production. For example, a Greenhouse requires minerals, water, and energy to build, but produces food and science.

## Game Progression

The game follows a realistic narrative of Mars colonization:
1. Initial resource gathering and basic infrastructure
2. Establishing sustainable energy and water systems
3. Developing food production and life support
4. Building research facilities and advancing technology
5. Creating self-sustaining habitats
6. Beginning the terraforming process
